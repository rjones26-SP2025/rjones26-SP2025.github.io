 - favorite animal
 - something you are interested in learning this semester

Hello, my name is Roy Jones.  A few of you may ask, the boxer?, and the answer would be no.
I would like to start with what I am interested in learning this semester.  I have decided to go back to school to enhance some of my technical skills specifically penetration testing and computer forensics.  And with many students, I'm taking this course as it is a requirement.  However, I am very interested in learning about HTML/CSS and JavaScript as I have not had any form training in those areas.
As for my favorite animal, I will have to say dogs.  For most of my life I have had at least one dog.  For me an my family, we have been able to see a noticible increase in our level of happiness when we have a dog versus not having one.
And now for the long and boring to most introduction to myself.  I am a veteran of the US Air Force and a US Marine Corps brat.  I am currently working as an Information & CyberSecurity / Data Ethics & Privacy Audit Manager at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).  In my current role, I perform internal, risk-based audits across the entire global company.  In the summer of 2024, I was part of the team that evaluated our internal Red Team.  As my offensive security skills are lacking, I looked for educational options and discovered WTCC's certificate programs.  This semester I am taking three classes that are pre-requisites to the two certificate programs.
I am looking forward to getting into the technical weeds.

Roy
